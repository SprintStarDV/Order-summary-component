Â¤ things i learned while coding this (will eventually update this section) :

-one thing i learned from people around me is that a web developper should know how to work smarter rather than harder..
which is a principle i applied in the way i used SVGs here.
i have learned to transform svg files in a way that could allow me to work with them more easily (converted some of them into PNGs instead)

-the use of the property `background-repeat: no repeat;`

-moving SVGs around via the `margin` property, playing with margins & paddings in general to position my content
